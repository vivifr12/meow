    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY LIL BRO <img src="img/rizz.jpg" alt="rizz" width="40" height="40"></h1>
    <p>okay im lowk making this while youre asleep BUT i genuinely almost didnt text you that day at first yk, i thought u were every intimidating❤️‍🩹 i dont think ive ever liked consistently talking to people much, but i do smile a little when i see you replied in class. i dont like getting out of bed much either, but it doesnt feel right not giggling at how bad (good) youre in vl. im so glad i didnt pussy out about texting you, cause i cant imagine what id be doing w my days if not spending them texting you under the table while with my friends. theres so many things id name off the top of my head that i love about you, youre genuinely perfect in all ways, but i love how i feel around you the most. i love the little tiktoks i see when i wake up and whatever that autistic goodmorning pic is.. i guess..but deadass i couldnt imagine enjoying stupid things like these before i met you, but yk you make them sound better than they used to. youre so so gorgeous and thats not even in the slightest the best thing about you. wether youre feeling your best, or your worst, i will be there no matter what. wether its talking about it or just sitting in silence till everything passes, youre never gonna be alone. youre such a gorgeous person inside and out, and every single day you make me sure of that more. i dont know what i would do with your sweet little presence in my life, waking up everyday knowing youre gonna be there missing sets all day, makes everything about it just the better. i love you my vl duo, get a little better. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!</p>
